Completed the initial base layer of collecting player input by using getch(). I ripped out the previous random player movement as well so now it is controlled by the player and their input. Started on the movePlayer function.

3/22/2025:
movePlayer function is complete with corrected player movement logic. This includes having a moveX and moveY for the corresponding input. I need to complete staircase implementation.

There are a lot of priority queue bugs currently, but it is shaping up to be complete. Created a staircase check that checks the pcTile and the player input for a staircase and resets the PQ. Also added more checks for monster livlieness and if the current turn is the player's.

3/24/2025:
Coding part of the assignment is complete. Full player movement with no tunneling or bugs is done. Staircase feature is complete.
