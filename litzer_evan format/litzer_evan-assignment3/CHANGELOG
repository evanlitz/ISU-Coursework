Created the distance map printing method to output the maps for testing.

Developed a parameter syster to differentiate between tunneling and non-tunneling monsters through a boolean parameter.
Created the two moves arrays for the djikistras algorithm to find new points around the current position.
Created the point struct to represent a point in djikistra's algortihm.
Made the visited array and began work on

Tunneling map is complete, non-tunneling is also complete. Did the loadDungeon case for when a file is loaded and 
needs distance mapping. Project is done.
