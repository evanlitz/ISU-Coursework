Started to change my code from C to C++, created all of the baseline header files that will be used later on. I also began fazing out the passed in parameters for the functions and instead using more object oriented programming.
Created the main function that declares a dungeon d and then runs its game loop.

Dungeon is fully functional in C++ for its base qualities, not for the new assignment requirements. Still some bugs but I am working on it.

Bugs for the normal dungeon functionality have been fixed, began working on input for the fog and teleportation base layer.

4/1/2025
The fog functionality is completely finished, and the boolean is stored in dungeon.

4/2/2025
Teleportation is done and assignment is ready to submit. Bug checking is continued, but I think I am done here.
