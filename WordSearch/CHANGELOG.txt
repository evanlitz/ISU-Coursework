Formatted the creation and management of the wordsearch grid, including inilitization of the maxSize and parameter checks for input of the grid size.
This includes filling the grid with '.' for unitialized squares and taking input from the terminal when calling wordsearch. 
Grid is now completely printed correctly with unitialized squared, ready to begin working with words.

Created the iteration loop for taking in word arguments from the terminal. Then started on insertWord function by taking wordLength and figured a 
way to create a random direction for the word to be placed, basically through a compass direction array that then decides what the next square would be.
Also made checks for when the direction would leave the grid. 
Need to figure out how to actually place the word now when it is valid.

Created the tempPositions array that iterates through the grid based on the randomly chosen compass direction.
Also shuffled an array of grid positions so that the words will be randomly placed in the grid. 
Shuffled the directions array as well to randomize what type of word placement is placed.

Loop that iterates through all possible positons and directions is complete. InsertWord still has some bugs and logic errors.
Will continue to test case, but mostly done. Also created the print puzzles in the main script to output to terminal.

Have tested a lot of edge cases and code is basically done. I am concerned if I am missing something regarding word intersection,
but my code suits over 99.9% of possibly generated puzzles. 
Fixed error handling and when an invalid word is entered. Wordsearch is done.
