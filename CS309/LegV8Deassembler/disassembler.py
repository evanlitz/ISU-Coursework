# The following file disassembles a LEGV8 machine code file that is in binary format into its translated assembly code. 
# It decodes the binary into the indicated instructions of R-Type, D-Type, I-Type, CB-Type, and B-Type instructions. 
# It also handles branch labels and maintains the branch label names so that jumps to branches are correctly carried out.
#   
# It first reads the file in as input through the main function's args parameter and prints the filename at the beginning of the output.
# It then bit traverse the file and stores the instructions into instructionsList seperated by bytes. Note that this file is for big-endian format only.
# Then the list of instructions are dissassembled, first by identifying their opcode through checking it with instruction-type lists and then calling the
# corresponding decode function for that opcode. The further decode functions are responsible for identifying other patts of the instruction besides opcode
# that is tailored to the opcode/instruction-type, like Rt, Rd, etc. Once the decode functions are done, the instruction is added to a decoded-instruction list
# that represents the assembly code. Labels are also accounted for correctly through a labels list that keeps track of numbered labels as the file is decoded.
# Finally, the decoded instructions are printed in correct assembly format.


# Below are the lists of instruction names based on opcode for each instruction type. Binary byte is checked for matching these opcodes, which is then further decoded
# into other required parts of the instruction based on the opcode/instruction-type. Includes R-Type, D-Type, I-Type, CB-Type, B-Type, and B-Conditions.
