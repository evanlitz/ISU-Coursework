Created the dungeon array of characters with appriopate bounds and set it all to rock. Created the structs for rooms and a room array to store vital room
position and measurement atrributes. Started on createRooms method.

CreateRooms method is done. Sizing and amount is valid. I now have it returning the total amount of rooms. PrintDungeon is also done for a helper method.

createUpStaircases and createDownStaircases are done. They randomly generate within one of the rooms chosen randomly.

Started on calculatePath and the connection iteration. Also created two helper methods to assist, including getRoomCenter and pathDistanceCalc to find the 
nearest room to the current room. I need to somehow make the path generation more random and not center to center.

Feburuary 3rd, 2025
generatePath is done. More checks have been implemented for path overlap with rooms and border. Rooms cannot border eachother anymore. Paths cannot interfere with
interior of rooms. Random changes in path is still needed.

Random generation in generatePath has been dealt with by randomizing the center position for the target position. I am really worried about the cluttering of the paths,
yet the requirements of the assignmet have been met, so....touche?
